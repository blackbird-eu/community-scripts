# URLFilter
Filter URLs for duplicates

## Description
URLFilter is a simple tool to filter a list of URLs for duplicates quickly and return unique results.

Our approach involves looking for common patterns and filtering for unique results. More filters will be added over time. Feedback and contributions are welcome as always of course.

## Usage
```
 $ cat urls.txt | go run main.go
```

## Installation
No third-party dependencies are required. Latest version of Golang is recommended.

```
 $ git clone https://github.com/novasecurityio/community-scripts.git
 $ cd community-scripts/URLFilter
```

You can additionally build and compile the Golang script and move/add it to your $PATH.
